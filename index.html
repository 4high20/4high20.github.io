    <h2>A brief story of my life</h2>
    <button id="storyButton">Show</button>
    <p id="storyParagraph">I've always been fascinated by computers since I was
      a child watching my bigger brother using his. I wrote my first website using windows notepad and html at 11 years old.
      I then wrote my first computer software at 12 using Visual Basic, it was a riddles game. Later I studyied some c++ at
      high school but at that time I was more into videogames then coding so I didn't practice much.
      After high school I began my poker career and didn't write a line of code for almost 10 years. Lately
      I've been re-exploring my old passion and got quite hooked to it, during the last months i've spent
      a lot of hours everyday studying fullstack javascript and practicing it.
      I hope I'll make it into Founders and Coders so that I'll be able to turn this passion into my job.
